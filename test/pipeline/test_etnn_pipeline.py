"""Pipeline smoke checks for the combinatorial ETNN config.

The fast test composes Hydra config only. The actual one-epoch training smoke
test is kept in this file but skipped by default because it may download and
preprocess MUTAG. That gives us a ready manual/CI check without making normal
unit-test runs depend on network/data availability.
