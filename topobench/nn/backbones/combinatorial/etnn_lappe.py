"""LapPE structural-coordinate ETNN backbone for combinatorial complexes.

This module provides a coordinate-enabled ETNN variant while keeping the
coordinate-free ETNN implementation in ``etnn.py`` unchanged. It is intended
for graph datasets, such as GraphUniverse, that do not provide physical
Euclidean coordinates but can support deterministic structural
pseudo-coordinates.

The construction is deliberately conservative:

1. TopoBench computes normalized graph Laplacian eigenvectors as rank-0
   structural coordinates with the existing ``LapPE`` transform.
2. Higher-rank cell coordinates are obtained by incidence averaging:

       p_0 = LapPE
       p_r = mean_{d incident to c} p_{r-1,d}

3. ETNN relation messages receive the original sparse-neighborhood scalar and
   one E(n)-invariant structural distance:

       z_{d,c,N} = concat(h_d, h_c, a_{d,c,N}, ||p_d - p_c||^2)

The coordinate update from the full ETNN formulation is still omitted. These
coordinates should be read as structural embeddings of the graph, not as
physical Euclidean coordinates.

class ETNNLapPE(nn.Module):
    """ETNN feature backbone with LapPE structural distance messages.

    The class mirrors the coordinate-free ``ETNN`` backbone but requires a
    rank-0 coordinate attribute, usually ``LapPE``, produced before
    graph-to-combinatorial lifting. For each relation edge from sender cell
    ``d`` to receiver cell ``c``, the relation-specific message function sees
    both the sparse TopoBench relation value ``a_{d,c,N}`` and the invariant
    scalar ``||p_d - p_c||^2``.

    This variant keeps ETNN's topological feature update structure:

        m_{c,N} = sum_{d in N(c)} psi_N(h_d, h_c, a_{d,c,N}, ||p_d-p_c||^2)
        h'_c    = h_c + beta_rank(c)(h_c, concat_N m_{c,N})

    The LapPE term is used only as an invariant message feature. Coordinates
    are not updated, so this module should be understood as a structural
    coordinate adaptation rather than a full coordinate-dynamical ETNN.

    The backbone expects the lifting/feature-encoding pipeline to provide
    feature tensors for every rank from 0 to ``max_rank``. Empty ranks should
    still be represented by zero-row tensors such as ``x_2.shape == [0, d]``;
    missing rank attributes are treated as malformed input.

    The layer has the same two aggregation levels as the coordinate-free ETNN:

    1. For each configured neighborhood relation ``N``, sender-cell messages

    2. For each destination rank, messages from all incoming relation types are
       concatenated and passed through a rank-specific update MLP.

    The only architectural difference is the relation edge attribute. Instead
    of using only the sparse neighborhood value ``a_{d,c,N}``, each message
    also sees ``||p_d - p_c||^2`` computed from LapPE-derived cell
    coordinates. This keeps the geometric signal invariant to translations,
    rotations, and reflections of the structural coordinate frame.

    Relation-message order is part of the model definition: messages are
    concatenated in the order given by ``self.neighborhoods``. The Hydra config
    therefore fixes both which relations are used and the channel order seen by
    the rank-wise update MLPs.
